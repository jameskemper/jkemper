            <h1>About the WRECKEM Model</h1>
            <p>This project combines my passion for March Madness with data analytics and is, hopefully, a neat educational tool for my students. The WRECKEM (weighted ratio efficiencies comparison model), named in honor of Texas Tech University, is designed to forecast outcomes of NCAA Men's Basketball games.</p>
            <p>The model incorporates concepts from Luke Benz's YUSAG model, the ELO ranking system, and NCAA Net Rankings. It assesses the impact of a team and their opponent’s offensive and defensive efficiencies, game location, strength of schedule, and historical performance on the point differential for a game.</p>
            <p>After calculating the various statistics, the model utilizes a straightforward weighted regression analysis:</p>
            <!-- Use MathJax to display the regression equation -->
            <p>$$ PD = \beta_{\text{Team}} X_{\text{AdjOffEff}} - \beta_{\text{Opp}} X_{\text{AdjDefEff}} + \beta_{\text{Loc}} X_{\text{Loc}} + \epsilon $$</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>PD</strong>: Point differential, defined as the difference in points scored by the two teams in a game.</li>
                <li><strong>X<sub>AdjOffEff</sub></strong>: Adjusted offensive efficiency              
<li><strong>X<sub>AdjOffEff</sub></strong>: Adjusted offensive efficiency of the team.</li>
                <li><strong>X<sub>AdjDefEff</sub></strong>: Adjusted defensive efficiency of the team.</li>
                <li><strong>X<sub>Loc</sub></strong>: The game location variable.</li>
                <li><strong>β<sub>Team</sub></strong>: Coefficient quantifying the impact of the team's adjusted offensive efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>β<sub>Opp</sub></strong>: Coefficient quantifying the impact of the opposing team's adjusted defensive efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>β<sub>Loc</sub></strong>: Coefficient quantifying the impact of the game location.</li>
                <li><strong>ε</strong>: The error term, capturing unobserved factors affecting the game's outcome.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Using the regression results, the model runs hundreds of iterations for each game to account for the unpredictability inherent in sports. These simulations provide a probabilistic forecast for future outcomes.</p>
